# Portfolio

### Description
This portfolio is made using HTML, CSS, VanillaJS, Material UI and ReactJS. For the layout I used flexbox and grid. For the contact form I managed to use the service that EmailJS provide for sending emails.

### How to run it
Open project > Go to terminal > Make sure you are in the portfolio folder > Run npm install command > Then write npm run dev to start the project using Vite 🧑‍💻
